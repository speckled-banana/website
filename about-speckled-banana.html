        <h1>Our values and principles</h1>
        <p>
          Life is rarely a case of black and white but in some cases we think
          that there is definitely a correct, honest way of doing things and
          then the 'other' way. Our values and principles ultimately come down
          to making decisions based on what is best for the end user of our
          services and what is best for the planet.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="values">

          <h2>Good for the planet</h2>
          <ul>
            <li class="card">
              We don't work with businesses that operate in sectors that are
              directly or indirectly having a negative impact on the planet such
              as the fossil fuel industry, industrial meat production, fast
              fashion etc.

            <li class="card">
              Servers that we host or operate on behalf of clients are always
              hosted using 100% renewable energy providers in juristictions with
              strong privacy laws.
            </li>
            <li class="card">
              We try to minimise file sizes wherever possible. Less data going

            We believe that you should be entitled to just as much privacy in
            the digital world as you are in the physical.
          </p>
          <p>Broadly we won't work on or with any of the following</p>

              Non privacy compliant tracking technologies such as Google
              Analytics, Facebook Pixel etc. If you want to know how many people
              are visiting your site and where your traffic is coming from that
              can all be done using privacy centric, GDPR compliant providers.
              We personally like
              <a href="https://plausible.io">Plausible</a> due to them being
              open source but there are several. We have a list of privacy
              friendly alternatives to some common services below.
            </li>
            <li class="card">
              Any dark design patterns, cookie notices where the obvious link to
              click is 'Accept' or you have to go through a load of clunky menus
              to reject for instance. By using privacy friendly services such as
              Plausible in a lot of cases you don't actually need to have a
              cookie notice.
            </li>

        <h2>How we work</h2>
        <p>
          We have three guiding principles for how we approach any project. Keep
          things:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Simple - New technologies come out every week, some stick around for
            years and become a new standard, others dissapear in a few months
            and were never production ready in the first place. Our job is to
            cut through the hype and use the simplest, most maintainable tool to
            solve the problem in hand.
          </li>
          <li></li>
          <li>
            Cost effective - Minimise costs wherever possible but not at the
            expense of data sovereignty or privacy.
          </li>
        </ol>
